This repo uses \`lb\` for all task management. All tasks live in Linear.

### Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
lb sync                    # Pull latest from Linear
lb ready                   # See unblocked work (issues with no blockers)
lb show LIN-XXX            # Read full description before starting
lb update LIN-XXX --status in_progress   # Claim it
\`\`\`

### Dependencies & Blocking

\`lb\` tracks relationships between issues. \`lb ready\` only shows unblocked issues.

\`\`\`bash
# This issue blocks another (other can't start until this is done)
lb create "Must do first" --blocks LIN-123

# This issue is blocked by another (can't start until other is done)
lb create "Depends on auth" --blocked-by LIN-100

# Found a bug while working on LIN-50? Link it
lb create "Found: race condition" --discovered-from LIN-50 -d "Details..."

# General relation (doesn't block)
lb create "Related work" --related LIN-200

# Manage deps after creation
lb dep add LIN-A --blocks LIN-B
lb dep remove LIN-A LIN-B
lb dep tree LIN-A          # Visualize dependency tree
\`\`\`

**Dependency types:**
- \`--blocks ID\` - This issue must finish before ID can start
- \`--blocked-by ID\` - This issue can't start until ID finishes
- \`--related ID\` - Soft link, doesn't block progress
- \`--discovered-from ID\` - Found while working on ID (creates relation)

### Planning Work (SUBISSUES, NOT BUILT-IN TODOS)

When you need to break down a task into steps, **create subissues in lb**:

\`\`\`bash
lb create "Step 1: Do X" --parent LIN-XXX -d "Details..."
lb create "Step 2: Do Y" --parent LIN-XXX -d "Details..."
lb create "Step 3: Do Z" --parent LIN-XXX --blocked-by LIN-YYY  # If order matters
\`\`\`

**Why subissues instead of your built-in task tools?**
- Subissues persist across sessions - built-in todos don't
- Other agents and humans can see them in Linear
- Dependencies are tracked properly
- Work doesn't get lost or duplicated

### Workflow

1. \`lb ready\` - Find unblocked work
2. \`lb update ID --status in_progress\` - Claim it
3. Work on it
4. Found new issue? \`lb create "Found: X" --discovered-from ID\`
5. \`lb close ID --reason "Done"\`

### Labels

Labels are arbitrary tags that flow through to Linear. Use them to categorize work, drive automation, or filter views.

\`\`\`bash
# Add labels when creating
lb create "Fix login bug" -l bug -l frontend

# Add/remove labels on existing issues
lb update LIN-XXX --label urgent
lb update LIN-XXX --unlabel frontend

# Filter by label
lb list --label frontend
lb list --label urgent --label frontend   # AND filter (must have both)
\`\`\`

Labels appear in \`lb show\`, \`lb list\`, \`lb ready\`, and \`lb blocked\` output.

You can set \`default_labels\` in \`.lb/config.jsonc\` to auto-apply labels to every new issue:
\`\`\`jsonc
{ "default_labels": ["my-project"] }
\`\`\`

### Viewing Issues

\`\`\`bash
lb list                    # All issues
lb list --status open      # Filter by status
lb list --label frontend   # Filter by label
lb ready                   # Unblocked issues ready to work
lb blocked                 # Blocked issues (shows what's blocking them)
lb show LIN-XXX            # Full details with all relationships
\`\`\`

### Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| \`lb sync\` | Sync with Linear |
| \`lb ready\` | Show unblocked issues |
| \`lb blocked\` | Show blocked issues with blockers |
| \`lb show ID\` | Full issue details + relationships |
| \`lb create "Title" -d "..."\` | Create issue |
| \`lb create "Title" -l label\` | Create with label |
| \`lb create "Title" --parent ID\` | Create subtask |
| \`lb create "Title" --blocked-by ID\` | Create blocked issue |
| \`lb update ID --status in_progress\` | Claim work |
| \`lb update ID --label name\` | Add label |
| \`lb update ID --unlabel name\` | Remove label |
| \`lb list --label name\` | Filter by label |
| \`lb close ID --reason "why"\` | Complete work |
| \`lb dep add ID --blocks OTHER\` | Add blocking dependency |
| \`lb dep tree ID\` | Show dependency tree |

### Rules

1. **NEVER use built-in task/todo tools** - ONLY \`lb\`
   - Not for planning, not for tracking, not for anything
   - Your memory can be wiped - \`lb\` tickets are persistent
   - If you need subtasks: \`lb create "..." --parent LIN-XXX\`
   - There is NO exception to this rule
2. **Always \`lb sync\` then \`lb ready\`** before asking what to work on
3. **Always \`lb show\`** to read the full description before starting
4. **Link discovered work** with \`--discovered-from\` to maintain context graph
5. **Include descriptions** with enough context for handoff
6. **Close with reasons** explaining what was done

### Why No Built-in Task Tools?

- **Built-in task tracking is ephemeral** - disappears when you're restarted
- **Other agents/humans can't see your internal todos** - they're siloed
- **Work gets lost or duplicated** - same task appears multiple times
- **Linear is the persistent source of truth** - everyone sees it

### Critical for AI Agents: Memory is Ephemeral

**Your memory can be wiped at any time.** Without external persistence:
- Critical decisions get lost
- You can't resume work from where you left off
- Other agents start from scratch

**Offload everything important to \`lb\` tickets:**
- Design decisions, context, research findings
- Implementation notes and code snippets  
- Blockers and dependencies
- "Where I left off" checkpoints

**Think of \`lb\` as your persistent brain supplement.** Your memory is cache, \`lb\` is database.

const ONBOARD_CONTENT = `# lb Onboard

This repo uses \`lb\` for Linear-backed issue tracking.

## Your Task

Add the following to your agent instruction file:
- **Claude Code**: CLAUDE.md
- **Other tools** (OpenCode, Cursor, etc.): AGENTS.md

Append to the file if it exists, create it if it doesn't.

---

${AGENTS_MD_CONTENT}

---

After adding the above, run \`lb sync\` then \`lb ready\` to find work.
